# SSVM Performance

## This page is outdated. Please [visit here for the most up-to-date content](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/why-webassembly-server/).

The Second State Virtual Machine \([SSVM](https://github.com/second-state/ssvm)\)  is an open source WebAssembly runtime optimized for server-side applications. The SSVM provides not only a WebAssembly runtime in Node.js, but also a compiler toolchain [ssvmup](https://github.com/second-state/ssvmup) for Rust and JavaScript.

#### Performance benchmarks

{% hint style="info" %}
The benchmark scores are in seconds. The smaller the better. The 👍emoji marks the two best performing runtimes for each benchmark. The docker+native runtime is a simple Ubuntu Docker on an Ubuntu host.
