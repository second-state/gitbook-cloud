# What is Second State?

## This page is outdated. Please [visit here for the most up-to-date content](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/why-webassembly-server/).

Second State builds the next generation open source “operating system” for the cloud and the decentralized web. The Second State Virtual Machine \(SSVM\) is a WebAssembly runtime optimized for server-side applications. It works seamlessly with existing application frameworks, such as Node.js, but provides a secure and lightweight runtime at native performance. It is a managed alternative to native code, and is ideal for building AI and big data microservices. [Check out why](server-side-webassembly/why/) you want to use WebAssembly on the server-side.

The SSVM also powers decentralized applications as the execution engine for leading public blockchains, such as [Ethereum 2.0](https://blog.secondstate.io/post/20191022-soll-compiler-project/), [Ethereum Classic](https://blog.secondstate.io/post/20190901-etc-partners-with-secondstate/), [Polkadot / Web3](https://blog.secondstate.io/post/20200302-polkadot-en/), [Oasis](https://www.coindesk.com/a16z-leads-45-million-raise-for-blockchain-startup-oasis-labs), and [CyberMiles](https://docs.secondstate.io/buidl-developer-tool/getting-started/develop-for-cybermiles).
